		<p>Jackson Avery was played by the actor, Jesse Williams. When Seattle Grace (Grey Sloan Memorial) merged with Mercy West in season 7, Jackson Avery was one of the Mercy West residents. For Jackson's first appearance in season 7 to his last appearance in season 19, he was extremely loved by the fanbase. Jackson quickly took the hearts of a lot of fans due to his humble personality and care for the people that surrounded him.  </p>
		<p>Jackson revealed that his last name came from an extremely big surgical foundation called the Harper Avery. The Harper Avery is an award that a lot of surgeons in the show strived to get. His grandfather, Harper, owned the foundation. Along with his mother, Cathrine, who ran the entire foundation. Jackson stemmed from a lot of money, however he remained extremely humble about it. He did not like people he worked with knowing his family history. </p>
		<p>Jackson grew up in a very rich environment, however that never stopped him for caring about the problems in the world. He still faced problems like racial discrimination everyday. Jackson always struggled with finding out what his purpose was. However, at the end of his showtime, Jackson decided to take over his family foundation - renamed from the Harper Avery Foundation to the Catherine Fox Foundation after his mother. Jackson left Seattle to move to Boston and run the foundation for the better good.</p>
		<p>Jackson ended up marrying April Kepner (another Mercy Wester) and had a baby whose name is Harriet. Jackson and April's relationship was very complicated, but in the end they ended up repairing it. Jackson moved to Boston with April and Harriet. Outside of the show, Jesse William was married from 2012-2023 to Aryn Drake-Lee. They had 2 children, Sadie and Maeco. However, Aryn and Jesse divorced.
